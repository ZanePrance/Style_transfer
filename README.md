# Style_transfer
Adaptive instance normalization style transfer algorithm  
Overview
The StyleTransfer project leverages the AdaIN approach to blend the content of one image with the style of another. This is achieved through a model that consists of an encoder, a style transfer module (AdaIN), and a decoder. The encoder captures the content and style features of the input images, the AdaIN module adapts the style features onto the content, and the decoder reconstructs the final image.
